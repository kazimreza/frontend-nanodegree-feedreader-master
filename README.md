Project Overview

Final Project of Udacity Front End Nano Degree – FeedReader

In this project I was a given a web-based
application that reads RSS feeds. My task was to write tests to make sure the
program runs as intended by the original programmer. I need to use the [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io)
to test the reading and loading functionality of the program.

Test will run as the program is loading and
validation results are are at the bottom of the page in Jasmine console.
