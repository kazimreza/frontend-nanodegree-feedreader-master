<h2>Project Overview</h2>

Final Project of Udacity Front End Nano Degree – FeedReader

In this project I was a given a web-based
application that reads RSS feeds. My task was to write tests to make sure the
program runs as intended by the original programmer. I need to use the [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io)
to test the reading and loading functionality of the program.

<h3>Jasmine Validation</h3>

Test will run as the program is loading and
validation results are are at the bottom of the page in Jasmine console.
